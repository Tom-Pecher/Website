            <h2>Traditional AI: Course Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the traditional artificial intelligence course! As I stated in the course description, this course covers algorithms that are considered AI but not considered machine learning.
                Most of these algorithms were popular when the field of AI first came to be.
                At this time, the general approach to AI was theoretical and mathematically pure; the belief was that by developing a theory of AI and stipulating a set of rules, we could create intelligent behaviour.
                Since then, this approach has been largely superceded by data-driven AI (in other words, machine learning), which is in line with my claims (see <a href="../../../AI.html">AI</a>) that intelligent behaviour is an emergent property of the universe (data) and cannot be reduced to a set of rules, at least not practically.
                Nevertheless, I believe it is important to understand these as they form the bedrock of the field and will give you a greater appreciation as to the methodology behind modern AI.
                Besides, these algorithms are interesting and still useful in several applications, even if those applications have changed considerably since they were originally conceived.
