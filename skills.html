        <h2>Love of Learning</h2>
        <p>I have always loved learning new things. 
            Strangely though, I have never been able to properly figure out why that is. 
            As a child, I was driven purely by curiosity, even at the expense of other things. 
            I was fortunate enough that, from a young age, my parents made the effort to take me frequently to public lectures on all manner of science and mathematics.
            Of course, I was almost always the youngest person there, which was rather amusing, and the material was well beyond my comprehension, but in many ways that only made me enjoy it more.
            Whenever there is a concept that I don't understand, the idea of it being a mystery is so cool to me that I cannot help but want to learn more about it.
            It is this itch that lead me to learn trigonometry at the age of 10, and the beginnings of calculus at the age of 12, when I should have probably been doing other things.
            I am pleased to say that I have matured somewhat since then; I have the discipline to focus my studies not just on the things I like, but that drive is the same (its current focus is on quantum machine learning).
            I have never seen myself as someone who is smarter than the rest, which is why I was always surprised to hear other people say so and as a child I could not understand why.
            Looking back now, I can definitively say it was because of this drive, where other people are discouraged by the weird and the complicated, I am only eager to learn more, and to this day that is what guides me forward.

        <h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
        <p>As I am pursuing a career in computer science, I am constantly trying to expand my knowledge. Soon, I hope to display my progress in the W3Schools courses, freeCodeCamp tutorials and much more (once I learn how to do that, of course):</p>
