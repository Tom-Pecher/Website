        <h2>Why I study AI</h2>
        <p>In my totally unbiased opinion, the study of artificial intelligence is by far the most interesting field in all of science.
            However, I also think that the name omits the most interesting aspect of the field.
            Despite the concept of AI being fairly old, scientists still fundamentally disagree on what "artificial intelligence" is even supposed to mean.
            I interpret this field as the study of intelligence (both natural and artificial) and how simple systems can display complex behaviour.
            I think that people often overlook the fact that AI is a study of ourselves just as much as it is a study of computer systems.
            Neural networks are intelligent agents, but so are humans and all living things, even society as a whole can be considered as a single self-sustaining agent.
            To me, the most interesting questions are not, "can we do this or that with AI?", eventually, we will probably do most things with AI.
            Rather, we should ask, what does this say about us as individuals, as a species, and how will we be changed because of it?
            No technological advancement is ever purely technological; people change technology and technology changes us back.
            I believe that this change is inevitable, but we have the agency to let AI be a change for better or for worse.
            And so, I study AI so that this change is a positive one, for all intelligent agents.
