        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings!
            My name is Tom Pecher and I am a fourth-year student of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath, welcome to my website!
            It is quite primitive at the moment as my experience with web development is limited and I am building it completely from scratch.
            However, I am actively learning and frequently improving it, so it should look a lot better soon, and besides it is easier than trying to add things to my LinkedIn account.
            I recently spent most of my time working on my third-year individual project, which layed out a comprehensive framework for applying reinforcement learning to optimise traffic control.
            I strive to be as well-rounded as possible, and so in my free time I am learning a bit of everything (see my <a href="https://github.com/Tom-Pecher" target="_blank">GitHub</a>).
            If you have any business inquiries, questions or just wish to network, please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact me</a>!

        <p>
            As has been popularised by Richard Feynman, one of the best ways of teaching yourself and/or confirming how much knowledge you truly have in an area is by first teaching others.
            Consequently, the following tutorials "blogs" are all on subjects that are important to me (and that I want to get better at).
            For this reason, they are learning resources for myself as well as anyone else who would be interested.
            If you want to learn more about any one of these areas, spot a mistake, or would just like to discuss ideas, please feel free to reach out, either on LinkedIn or my email (see my <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact page</a>).
        
            <br><br>
            <em><b>Disclaimer:</b></em> Since these tutorials involve me divulging my knowledge in an accessible manner, my teaching, examples and code are all rather informal.
            To be clear, I will go into considerable depth in these areas, however I will often explain concepts using everyday language, as the aim of these journals is to explain abstract concepts to myself whilst also providing an introduction to fields that you may be unfamiliar with.
            If you are looking for more formal and rigorous explanations, these may not be what you are looking for.
